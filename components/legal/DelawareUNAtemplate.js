          requirement may be waived in whole or in part for persons of low

          deny for any arbitrary purpose or lack of purpose.
          <Br />
          <Br />
          All of the DAO governing members shall have their membership
          determined upon receipt of voting tokens, deployed at address{" "}
          {address}, secured on a public blockchain (“Cryptographic Units”, and
          such holders, “Members”). Cryptographic Units are used for
          participating in and improving the governance of the DAO through
          affirmative majority votes effectuted via the Designated Smart
          Contract (defined herein) (such process, “Cryptographic Consensus”).
          Once the admission requirements are met a prospective Member may be
          put up to a vote of the full membership or similar process enabled by
          the Designated Smart Contract. The DAO will consistently review, and
          if necessary, Members may make adjustments to the admission
          requirements based on their evolving needs and as registered in a
          successful vote through the Designated Smart Contract.

          Blockchain Address) as the exclusive method of holding, allocating
          rights and obligations among the Members, and spending, or otherwise
          distributing any Tokens that are DAO Property, of minting and issuing
          Cryptographic Units and holding and recording votes among the Members.
          The DAO may also utilize the Designated Smart Contract to administer
          and facilitate certain other arrangements and transactions involving
          the DAO, the Members and/or third parties.
          <Br />
          <Br />
          Members’ rights and responsibilities are controlled by the use of the
          Designated Smart Contact used to conduct its governance and activities
          of the DAO. Members will cast votes and carry out the decisions made
          on the Designated Smart Contract. Cryptographic Units are held in
          Account Addresses, key paired wallets controlled by Members in a
          designated hexadecimal address (“Member Web3 Account”).

          If you have received any Cryptographic Units or are otherwise a

          To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, no Member shall be

          In any dispute between the DAO and any of its Members or former

          an impartial mediator may facilitate negotiations between the parties
          and assist them in developing a mutually acceptable settlement.
          Neither party with a grievance against the other shall have recourse
          to litigation until the matter is submitted to mediation and attempted
          to be resolved in good faith. All Members agree that there is a
          preference to settle disputes amongst Members or between Members and
          the DAO via decentralized dispute mechanisms in smart contract
          protocols.

          vote to burn such withdrawaing DAO Member's Cryptographic Units or
          mechanisms otherwise authorized in the Designated Smart Contract. Any
          such withdrawal request will not be unreasonably denied and shall be
          deemed conclusively as the DAO Member’s intent to withdraw from the
          DAO. A Member may be expelled by the DAO through the Guild Kick
          procedure established in paragraph 2.6 of this document and adopted by
          the membership. Upon termination of membership, all rights and
          interests in the DAO shall cease except for rights to redemption of
