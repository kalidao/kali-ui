          the best interest of the DAO LLC, and with respect to any criminal
          action proceeding, have no reasonable cause to believe their conduct

          judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of “no lo
          Contendere” or its equivalent, shall not in itself create a
          presumption that the person did or did not act in good faith and in a
          manner which they reasonably believed to be in the best interest of
          the DAO LLC, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding,
          had reasonable cause to believe that their conduct was lawful.

          otherwise, by reason of being or acting as Manager of the DAO LLC. No
          Manager shall be personally liable to the DAO LLC or its Members for
          any action undertaken or omitted in good faith reliance upon the
          provisions of this Agreement, and the DAO LLC shall indemnify such
          Managers for the same, unless the acts or omissions of the Manager
          were not in good faith or involved criminal activity, willful
          misconduct, fraud, or a knowing violation or breach of this Agreement;
          provided, however, that each Manager shall owe, and shall act in a
          manner consistent with, fiduciary duties to the DAO LLC and its
          Members of the nature, and to the same extent, as those owed by
          directors of a Delaware corporation. Additionally, the DAO LLC may
          provide additional liability protection by entering into individual
          indemnification contracts with Managers. For the avoidance of doubt
          the DAO LLC may also enter into individual indemnification contracts
          with its Members, officers, employees, and agents.
